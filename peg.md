# Peg

## Backgrounds

Blockchain interoperability actually comes from connecting two or more different chains and validating each other's information. There are various ways to prove it, but among that pegging is one of the most basic and widely used methodology for implementing blockchain-interoperabiltiy. 

### Peg

The definition of Peg, the word itself has been used even before blockchain, is 'A short pin or bolt, typically tapered at one end, that is used for securing something in place, hanging things on, or marking a position.'[1] Following after, the word 'pegged' is used as stable and mostly used in currencies. 

But in the blockchain, peg is used among the two or more different blockchains. 

There are several ways of pegging way but typically it can be differentiated by 2 ways : One-way peg, Two-way peg. And it's differentiated by the way chains got pegged. 

### One-way peg

### Two-way peg

### Relay



### Bridge



### Sidechain
사이드체인이란 부모 체인(parent chain)과 대비해 사용하는 용어다. 관심을 가지고 지켜보는 체인을 부모 체인 또는 그냥


## 왜?
TBA

## 어떻게? (기술)

### block header validation
* issue: memory hard (script) PoW validation의 문제
  * 평가
  * 방법
     * Truebit
     * BulletProof <- 추가 조사 필요
* issue: 다른 consensus는 어떻게 구현하나, 검증하나
  * 가령 경제학적인 구조에 기반을 둔 consensus
* privacy coin 류 검증은 어떻게 하는가?

## 분류

### 방향성으로 분류
* one-way-peg
* two-way-peg
  * smart contract를 이용
  * collateralized peg

### Relay를 기준으로 분류
* (가제) centralized-peg
* federate-peg (federated?)

Federate peg is more de-centralized than centralized-peg. Its process is mostly similar with those of multi-signature transaction. As you can see in the term itself, the federation exists in federate-peg. Federation is composed of several different entities and each of them has sort of private keys. They all together mutli-signatuer wallet , which deposit exists. 

  * Hub
  
  For COSMOS Hub is the genesis Zone of its ecosystem. Basically, Hub is connected with all the other zones. So if, the zone A  
  and B is trying to exchange they have
  
  * multi-sig
  
  Same as the muli-sig wallet federated peg also work in the same way. 
  
### 방법에 대한 분류
* add new opcode
* SPV proof
  * 모든 blocks
  * superblock
